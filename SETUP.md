# Quick Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get your secure AI chat app running for the Auth0 for AI Agents Challenge!

## Step 1: Set Up Auth0 (Free Account)

1. Go to **[auth0.com](https://auth0.com)** and create a free account
2. After logging in, click **Applications** â†’ **Create Application**
3. Name it **"Secure AI Chat"**
4. Choose **"Regular Web Applications"**
5. Click **Create**

## Step 2: Configure Auth0 Application

In your new Auth0 application's **Settings** tab, scroll down and configure:

### Find These Values (You'll Need Them):
- **Domain**: Look like `dev-abc123.us.auth0.com`
- **Client ID**: Long string of letters and numbers
- **Client Secret**: Another long string (click to reveal)

### Set These URLs:

**Allowed Callback URLs:**
```
https://your-replit-url.repl.co/api/auth/callback
```
(Replace `your-replit-url` with your actual Replit URL - you can find it in the webview)

**Allowed Logout URLs:**
```
https://your-replit-url.repl.co/
```

**Allowed Web Origins:**
```
https://your-replit-url.repl.co
```

Click **Save Changes** at the bottom!

## Step 3: Add Secrets in Replit

1. In Replit, look for **"Tools"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Secrets"**
3. Add these 5 secrets:

| Secret Name | Where to Get It |
|------------|----------------|
| `AUTH0_DOMAIN` | From Auth0 Settings (like `dev-abc123.us.auth0.com`) |
| `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` | From Auth0 Settings |
| `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` | From Auth0 Settings (click to reveal) |
| `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | Your NVIDIA API Key |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Any random string (e.g., `my-super-secret-key-12345`) |

## Step 4: Test the App!

1. The app should automatically restart after adding secrets
2. Click the green **"Run"** button if needed
3. Open the webview
4. You should see a login screen
5. Click **"Login with Auth0"**
6. Create an account or login
7. Start chatting with the AI!

## Step 5: Using the File Upload Feature

This application supports uploading `.txt` and `.pdf` files to enhance the AI's knowledge base for your chats. Here's how to use it:

1.  **Select a Chat**: Ensure you have an active chat selected in the sidebar. If not, create a new chat.
2.  **Click Upload Button**: Click the "Upload File" button (paperclip icon) next to the message input field.
3.  **Choose File**: Select a `.txt` or `.pdf` file from your local machine.
4.  **File Processing**: The file will be uploaded, and its content will be extracted. For `.txt` files, text is read directly. For `.pdf` files, text is extracted page by page.
5.  **AI Integration**: The extracted text will be used to augment the AI's responses within that specific chat, providing context from your uploaded documents.

## Troubleshooting

**If login doesn't work:**
- Make sure all 5 secrets are added
- Check that the Auth0 callback URLs match your Replit URL exactly
- Try refreshing the page

**If you see "Authorization error":**
- Make sure the `NVIDIA_API_KEY` secret is set correctly

**If the app won't start:**
- Check the console logs for any error messages
- Make sure all environment variables are set

## Testing for the Challenge

To test that user isolation is working:
1. Login with one account
2. Create a chat and send a message
3. Logout
4. Login with a different account (or create a new one)
5. You should see NO chats - each user only sees their own!

## Next Steps for Challenge Submission

Once everything is working:
1. Test the authentication flow thoroughly
2. Create a few example chats to show functionality
3. Take screenshots of the working app
4. Write your submission post on DEV.to using the challenge template
5. Include setup instructions and explain how you implemented the 3 security requirements

Good luck with the challenge! ðŸš€

## Step 5: Run the Application (for Deployment)

To run the application in a production environment using Gunicorn, navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and execute:

```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
```

This will start the Gunicorn server on port 8000, making your Flask application accessible.

## Fine-Grained Authorization for RAG Pipelines

This application implements fine-grained authorization for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines by ensuring that each user's chat history is securely isolated. The `database.py` module stores chat messages associated with a unique `user_id`, which is securely retrieved from the Auth0 session in `app.py`. This design prevents unauthorized access to sensitive chat data, as AI agents (and users) can only retrieve and interact with chat histories belonging to their authenticated `user_id`. This is visually reinforced in the UI with the "Securely Personalized" indicator next to the username.
