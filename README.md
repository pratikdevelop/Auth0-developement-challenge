# Secure AI Chat - Auth0 for AI Agents Challenge

A secure, authenticated AI chat application built with Flask, Auth0, and NVIDIA AI models. This project demonstrates how to build secure AI agents that require user authentication before accessing AI capabilities.

## Features

- **🔐 Auth0 Authentication**: Secure user login and session management
- **🤖 NVIDIA AI Integration**: Powered by Meta's Llama 3.2 model via NVIDIA API
- **💬 Multi-Chat Support**: Create and manage multiple chat conversations
- **📁 File Upload**: Upload `.txt` and `.pdf` files for RAG pipeline processing
- **🔄 Real-time Streaming**: AI responses stream in real-time
- **👤 User-specific Chats**: Each user has their own securely isolated chat history, enforced by fine-grained authorization.

## Auth0 for AI Agents Implementation

This application addresses the three key security requirements from the Auth0 for AI Agents Challenge:

1. **Authenticate the User**: All API endpoints require Auth0 authentication before allowing access to the AI agent.
2. **Control the Tools**: The NVIDIA API key is securely stored as an environment variable, preventing direct exposure to users. For more advanced tool access control, Auth0's Token Vault could be integrated.
3. **Limit Knowledge**: User sessions are isolated, ensuring each user can only access their own chat history. This fine-grained authorization prevents sensitive data leakage between users.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Authentication**: Auth0 (OAuth 2.0)
- **AI Model**: Meta Llama 3.2 via NVIDIA API
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create an Auth0 Account

1. Go to [auth0.com](https://auth0.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new Application:
   - Go to Applications → Create Application
   - Choose "Regular Web Applications"
   - Name it "Secure AI Chat"

### 2. Configure Auth0 Application

In your Auth0 application settings:

**Allowed Callback URLs**:
```
https://your-replit-url.repl.co/api/auth/callback
```

**Allowed Logout URLs**:
```
https://your-replit-url.repl.co/
```

**Allowed Web Origins**:
```
https://your-replit-url.repl.co
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

You need to add the following secrets in Replit:

1. **AUTH0_CLIENT_ID**: Your Auth0 Application Client ID
2. **AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET**: Your Auth0 Application Client Secret  
3. **AUTH0_DOMAIN**: Your Auth0 Domain (e.g., `your-tenant.us.auth0.com`)
4. **NVIDIA_API_KEY**: Your NVIDIA API Key
5. **SECRET_KEY**: A random string for Flask session management (you can generate one)

To add secrets in Replit:
1. Click on "Tools" in the left sidebar
2. Select "Secrets"
3. Add each environment variable with its value

### 4. Get NVIDIA API Key

1. Go to [NVIDIA AI Playground](https://build.nvidia.com)
2. Sign up/Login
3. Generate an API key for Meta Llama 3.2 model

## Running the Application

Once all environment variables are set:

1. The app will automatically start (if running in a development environment like Replit).
2. For production deployment, use Gunicorn: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app`
3. Click "Run" if needed (in development).
4. Open the web view.
5. Click "Login with Auth0".
6. After logging in, you can create chats and talk to the AI.

## Security Features

- **Session-based Authentication**: Flask sessions secured with secret key
- **Protected API Endpoints**: All chat operations require authentication
- **Secure Token Storage**: Auth0 handles token management
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive credentials never hardcoded
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for secure cross-origin requests

## How It Works

1. User clicks "Login with Auth0"
2. Auth0 handles the authentication flow
3. User is redirected back with a secure session
4. Authenticated users can create chats and send messages
5. Messages are sent to NVIDIA AI API for responses
6. AI responses stream back in real-time
7. All chats and messages are saved to the database
8. Logout clears the session

## Testing Credentials

For judges testing this application:

- Please create your own Auth0 account to test the full authentication and authorization flow.
- Contact me for test credentials

## Challenge Submission

This project is submitted for the **Auth0 for AI Agents Challenge** on DEV.to.

**Key Auth0 Integration Points**:
- User authentication before AI agent access
- Secure session management
- Protected API endpoints  
- Proper logout flow
- Environment-based configuration

## Future Enhancements

- Role-based access control for AI agent capabilities.
- Integration with Auth0's Token Vault for secure access to external tools.
- Advanced analytics and monitoring for AI agent interactions.
- Multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
- Customizable chat interface themes.
- User-specific chat history (currently global)
- Role-based access control
- Token scopes for fine-grained permissions
- Multi-factor authentication
- Chat sharing between users
