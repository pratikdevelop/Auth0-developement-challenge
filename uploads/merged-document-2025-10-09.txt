# Project Documentation: Custom PHP Web Application for Member Management System

## Document Overview
**Date:** October 06, 2025  
**Client Requirement:** Development of a PHP-based web application based on 
provided handwritten wireframes (original + additional 5 images). The app 
focuses on member registration, verification (via Aadhaar OTP), management, 
death claims processing, donations (including annual/Varshik Dan), police 
verification, nominee handling, and admin dashboards for district/state core 
teams.  

This document provides a high-level description of all key pages and features 
derived from the uploaded images. It includes UI/UX flows, form fields, and 
functionalities. The application will be built using PHP (with MySQL for 
database, Bootstrap for frontend, and libraries like TCPDF for PDF generation, 
PHPMailer for emails, and Twilio/WA API for WhatsApp if needed). Security 
features include Aadhaar OTP integration (via UIDAI API), file upload 
validation, role-based access (Admin, District User, State Team, Member), and 
duplicate checks for transactions.

# Project Documentation: Custom PHP Web Application for Member Management System

## Document Overview
**Date:** October 06, 2025  
**Prepared by:** Grok (xAI Assistant)  
**Client Requirement:** Development of a PHP-based web application based on 
provided handwritten wireframes (original + additional 5 images). The app 
focuses on member registration, verification (via Aadhaar OTP), management, 
death claims processing, donations (including annual/Varshik Dan), police 
verification, nominee handling, and admin dashboards for district/state core 
teams.  

This document provides a high-level description of all key pages and features 
derived from the uploaded images. It includes UI/UX flows, form fields, and 
functionalities. The application will be built using PHP (with MySQL for 
database, Bootstrap for frontend, and libraries like TCPDF for PDF generation, 
PHPMailer for emails, and Twilio/WA API for WhatsApp if needed). Security 
features include Aadhaar OTP integration (via UIDAI API), file upload 
validation, role-based access (Admin, District User, State Team, Member), and 
duplicate checks for transactions.

## Table of Contents
1. [User Roles](#user-roles)
2. [Key Pages and Features](#key-pages-and-features)
3. [Database Structure Outline](#database-structure)
4. [Technical Stack](#technical-stack)
5. [Development Cost Estimate](#development-cost-estimate)

## User Roles
- **Admin**: Full access to create users, reset passwords, manage all members, 
approve applications, generate OTPs via SMS/Email/WhatsApp.
- **District User/Member**: View/edit own details, submit applications (e.g., 
death claims, donations), access district dashboard, upload receipts.
- **State Core Team**: Review/approve district submissions, generate reports, 
download PDFs, verify transactions.
- **President/Commission User**: Login-specific views for oversight, password 
changes.
- **Nominee**: Limited access for death claims (OTP verification only).

## Key Pages and Features
Based on all wireframes (~20-25 interconnected pages). Summarized by module, 
with new additions marked (*New*).

# Project Documentation: Custom PHP Web Application for Member Management System

## Document Overview
**Date:** October 06, 2025  
**Client Requirement:** Development of a PHP-based web application based on 
provided handwritten wireframes (original + additional 5 images). The app 
focuses on member registration, verification (via Aadhaar OTP), management, 
death claims processing, donations (including annual/Varshik Dan), police 
verification, nominee handling, and admin dashboards for district/state core 
teams.  

This document provides a high-level description of all key pages and features 
derived from the uploaded images. It includes UI/UX flows, form fields, and 
functionalities. The application will be built using PHP (with MySQL for 
database, Bootstrap for frontend, and libraries like TCPDF for PDF generation, 
PHPMailer for emails, and Twilio/WA API for WhatsApp if needed). Security 
features include Aadhaar OTP integration (via UIDAI API), file upload 
validation, role-based access (Admin, District User, State Team, Member), and 
duplicate checks for transactions.
